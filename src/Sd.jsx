Stamp duty is: <br /><br />

• Rounded up to the nearest £5. <br /><br />

• Not chargeable on consideration of less than £1,000. • From 28 April 2014, transfers of securities admitted to trading on recognised growth markets are exempt from stamp duty. <br /><br />

• Shares transferred to a clearance service or depositary receipt issuer as a result of the exercise of an option are now charged the 1.5% higher rate of stamp duty based on either their market value or the option strike price, whichever is higher. The change applies to options exercised on or after 23 March 2016 which were entered into on or after 25 November 2015. <br /><br />

Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (SDRT) is a tax on electronic paperless share transactions.<br /><br />
 
You pay SDRT on paperless transactions when you buy:<br /><br />

• Shares in a UK company.<br /><br />

• Shares in a foreign company with a share register in the UK.<br /><br />

• An option to buy shares.<br /><br />

• Rights arising from shares already owned.<br /><br />

•  An interest in shares, like an interest in the money made from selling them.
