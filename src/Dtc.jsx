    <h3>Donations to Charity</h3>
    <p>
        <h4>Claim Gift Aid on Charity Donations</h4>

Donating through Gift Aid means charities and community amateur sports clubs (CASCS) can claim an extra 25p for every £1 you give. It will not cost you any extra and you can look for tax relief in your Self-Assessment. <br /><br />

Under the Gift Aid Scheme an individual donor can claim higher rate tax relief and, if applicable, additional rate relief on the grossed-up amount of the monetary donation against income and Capital Gains Tax. <br /><br />

If you're planning to make charitable donations, why not chat with us in advance to ensure that you maximise your giving through harnessing the generous tax incentives available.

<h4>Donating straight from your wages or pension</h4>

If your employer, company or personal pension provider runs a Payroll Giving scheme, you can donate straight from your wages or pension. This happens before tax is deducted from your income if they run a Payroll Giving scheme. <br /><br />

The tax relief you get depends on the rate of tax you pay. To donate £1, you pay: <br /><br />

• 80p if you're a basic rate taxpayer <br /><br />

• 60p if you're a higher rate taxpayer <br /><br />

• 55p if you're an additional rate taxpayer <br /><br />

The tax relief you get is different if you live in Scotland. To donate £1, you pay:<br /><br />

• 81p if you're a starter rate taxpayer <br /><br />

• 80p if you're a basic rate taxpayer<br /><br />

• 79p if you're a intermediate rate taxpayer<br /><br />

• 59p if you're a higher rate taxpayer 54p if you're a top rate taxpayer

<h4>Note:</h4>

You cannot donate to a community amateur sports club (CASC) through Payroll Giving.

Donating land, property or shares

You do not have to pay tax on land, property or shares you donate to charity. This includes selling them for less than their market value.

You get tax relief on both:

• Income tax; and

Capital Gains Tax.

Note:

You cannot get Income Tax relief on donations to community amateur sports clubs (CASCS).

<h4>Leaving gifts to charity in your will</h4>

Your will says what will happen to your money, property and possessions after you die. <br /><br />

Your donation will either: <br /><br />

• be taken off the value of your estate before Inheritance Tax is calculated; or<br /><br />

• reduce your Inheritance Tax rate, if 10% or more of your estate is left to charity.<br /><br />

<h4>You can donate:</h4>
• fixed amount; <br /><br />
• fixed item.
