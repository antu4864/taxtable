          <h4> Work use of own vehicle</h4>
          If you use a vehicle for work as an employee, then you can claim for
          business mileage when using your own personal vehicles, asfollows:
          <h4>Approved mileage rates (from 2011/12)</h4>
          • Cars: the first 10,000 miles is claimable at 45p per mile and 25p
          thereafter. <br />
          <br />
          • Car passenger: 5p per mile.
          <br />
          <br />
          • Motorbikes: 24p per mile.
          <br />
          <br />
          • Bicycles: 20p per mile.
          <br />
          <br />
          Don't forget that if your employer reimburses you for business mileage
          at a rate per mile which is lower than the Authorised Mileage Rate,
          you are entitled to claim the difference against your taxable income.{" "}
          <br />
          <br />
          Don't worry, if we prepare a tax return for you, we will automatically
          make the claim on your behalf.
          <h4>Company car, but employee pays for the fuel</h4>
          If you have a company car but you are required to pay for the fuel,
          you can claim for business mileage at the advisory fuel rates.
          <h5>Advisory mileage rates</h5>
          Advisory fuel rates are set by HMRC for employers to use when
          reimbursing their employee company car drivers for business fuel,
          where those employees are responsible for paying the cost of fuel.
          Provided the rates are not exceeded, their payments are free of tax.
          <br />
          <br />
          • They can also be used if employees are required to reimburse the
          cost of fuel used for private travel, where the employer is
          responsible for paying the cost of fuel.
          <br />
          <br />
          • Don't forget that if you pay the cost of fuel consumed by your
          company car and your employer reimburses you for business mileage at a
          rate per mile, which is lower than the Advisory Mileage Rate, you are
          entitled to claim the difference against your taxable income.
          <br />
          <br />
          • Don't worry, if we prepare a tax return for you, we will
          automatically make the claim on your behalf.
          <br />
          <br />
          • Advisory mileage rates should not be used in relation to vans.
          <br />
          <br />
          • As an employer, you can only reclaim input VAT where your employee
          supplies a receipt.
