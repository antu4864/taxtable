           <h3> Land Tax</h3>
           <p>
You must pay Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) if you buy property or land over a certain price in England. <br /><br />
 If you live in Scotland you are subject to the equivalent to

SDLT, which is known as Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (LBTT). <br /><br />

Since 2018 Wales has also had its own version of land tax known as Land Transaction Tax (LTT).

<h4>        Note:</h4>

• The applicable rate is charged on the proportion of consideration falling within each band.<br /><br />

• You'll usually have to pay 3% on top of the normal SDLT rates if buying a new residential property means you have an interest in more than one property. <br /><br />
• You will not pay the extra 3% if the property you're

buying is replacing a main residence that has already been sold. <br /><br />

• If there's a delay selling your main residence and it has not been sold on the day you complete your new purchase, you will have to pay the 4% because you own 2 properties. Although, you may be entitled to a refund if it is sold within 36 months of the date of your new purchase. <br /><br />

• The higher rate can also be payable by companies and certain trusts. <br /><br />

• SDLT also applies to transfers of an interest in land into or out of a partnership, and to an acquisition of an interest in a partnership where the partnership property includes an interest in land. <br /><br />

• SDLT additionally applies to transfers of partnership interests but only where the sole or main activity of the partnership is investing or dealing in interests in land. <br /><br />

• From April 2021 an additional 2% surcharge has been introduced for UK property purchases made by a non UK resident. This surcharge will be in addition to the 3% surcharge for second homes - taking the possible top rate of SDLT for overseas buyers to 17%. <br /><br />

• a company acting as a trustee of a settlement;  <br /><br />

• the property is subject to an equity release scheme; • a company to use in a property rental business, or  <br /><br />
