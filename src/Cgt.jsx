   <h3>Capital Gains Tax</h3>
   <p>
   Capital Gains Tax is a tax on any gain you've made when you sell an 'asset' that's increased in value during your period of ownership. <br /><br />

It's the gain you make that is taxed, not the disposal proceeds. <br /><br />

During his March 2021 Budget speech the Chancellor announced the Annual Exemption threshold will remain frozen until 5 April 2026. <br /><br />

Over recent years Capital Gains Tax has become ever more complex and certain assets are tax-free. If you think that you are likely to be affected, why not talk to us to ensure that you get the right advice for your needs. <br />

You may be able to pay less Capital Gains Tax when you sell (or 'dispose of') all or part of your business. This is through Entrepreneurs' Relief in which you will pay tax at 10% on all gains on qualifying assets.

<h4>Chattels exemption</h4>

Certain chattels are exempt from CGT including motor cars and assets with a predictable life of 50 years or less (called wasting assets). <br /><br />

The exemption does not apply if the chattels have been used in a business. A gain, arising on the disposal of a chattel, is exempt if the consideration is £6,000 or less.

<h4>Note:</h4>

The word 'chattel' is a legal term meaning an item of tangible, movable property - something you can both touch and move. For example, your personal possessions will normally be chattels. <br /><br />
