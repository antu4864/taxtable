          <h3> Investing and Savings</h3>
          The Individual Savings Account, also known as an ISA, is a tax-free
          way to save. In a normal savings account you may be charged tax on the
          interest you earn, so an ISA is a great way for tax-free savings.{" "}
          <br />
          <br />
          The good news is all investments in ISAs are tax and capital gains
          free and you can take money out without losing tax benefits.

          <h3>Lifetime ISAs</h3>
          From 6 April 2017 if you are between the ages of 18 and 40 you can
          save £4,000 p.a. into a Life Time ISA. Then, at the end of the year
          the government provides a 25% top-up. <br />
          <br />
          Once you've started you can continue to contribute and get the 25%
          top-up until you're 50. <br />
          <br />
          While you can make withdrawals prior to age 60 you will forfeit the
          government's top-up. Whereas, withdrawals on or after your 60th
          birthday are tax free. <br />
          <br />
          Once you have held your LISA for more than one year it can also be
          used to purchase a first-time house purchase without the loss of the
          government's bonus.
          <h4>Help to Buy ISA</h4>
          Available from 1 December 2015 to 30 December 2019 the purpose of a
          Help to Buy ISA is to help would-be first time-buyers to save for a
          house purchase deposit.
          <br />
          <br />
          The maximum you can save per month is £200 and, as with the LISA, the
          government then gives a 25% top-up. The maximum bonus (top-up) you can
          receive is £3,000 on £12,000.
          <br />
          <br />
          Help to Buy ISAs can be used against first time London property
          purchase up to £450,000, or £250,000 elsewhere in the UK.
          <h4>Note:</h4>
          If you have already opened a Help to Buy ISA (or did so before 30
          November 2019), you will be able to continue saving into your account
          until November 2029.
