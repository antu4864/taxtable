            <h3>Pensions</h3>
            <p>
            A pension is a long-term tax-efficient savings plan - a way to save money during your working life to help fund you in your retirement.<br /><br />

As a general rule, if you are a UK-resident taxpayer under the age of 75, you can contribute to your pension as much as you earn each year, up to the annual allowance of £40,000.<br /><br />

If you are not earning enough to pay income tax, you can still receive tax relief on pension contributions up to a maximum of £3,600 a year.

<h5>Individual contributions</h5>

Tax relief on contributions is restricted to the higher of:

• the full amount of relevant earnings; or<br /><br />

• £3,600, provided the scheme operates tax relief at source.<br /><br />

Subject to the annual allowance. <br /><br />

<h4>Note:</h4>

• If the annual increase in an individual's rights under all registered schemes exceeds their annual allowance, the excess is chargeable at the individual's marginal rate. <br /><br />

• An individual is liable for the tax, unless they make an election for the scheme to pay the charge if it exceeds £2,000. <br /><br />
• Unused allowances may be carried forward for up to three years. <br /><br />

• Where an individual has made a flexi-access drawdown from their money purchase pension fund their annual allowances is split between the money purchase inputs and defined benefit inputs. <br /><br />

• The result is a money purchase allowances of £4,000 and an alternative £36,000 annual allowance applicable to any defined benefit contributions. <br /><br />

• The £4,000 money purchase allowance cannot be increased by amounts brought forward. <br /><br />

• A taper reduction of £1 for every £2 over is applied to the annual allowance, where an individual has adjusted net taxable income in excess of £200,000 (£150,000, 2019/20). <br /><br />

• The annual allowance will only begin to taper for those who have an income above £240,000 - the £200,000 allowance plus the £40,000 you can save into a pension.

<h4>Employer contributions</h4>

Employer contributions into a registered scheme are deductible for tax purposes.

<h4>Note:</h4>

• If there is a large increase in the level of employer contributions from one chargeable period to the next tax relief may be spread. <br /><br />

• Establishing if tax relief on an employer contribution to a registered pension scheme needs to be spread is a 4-stage process: <br /><br />

• Establish what contributions have been paid in the current and previous chargeable period. <br /><br />
• If there has been a change in the length of chargeable periods adjust the periods to the same length.<br /><br />
• Compare the relevant contributions in the current and previous chargeable periods to work out if there has been an excess and if so how much.<br /><br />

• Is the excess more than £500,000?<br /><br />

• Only tax relief on an 'excess' contribution of £500,000 or more will be spread.<br /><br />

• The length of time the tax relief will be spread over depends on the size of the excess.<br /><br />

<h5>Spreading relief is a complex area, speak to us, we are here to help you to navigate is.</h5>

There is no financial limit set on the amount you can contribute to your pension, and you can claim tax relief in any tax year. Tax relief is available on private pension contributions up to the value of 100% of your annual earnings.<br /><br />

The maximum age for pension relief is 74 years of age. Pensions inherited after 75 years of age will be subject to the recipient's marginal rate of tax.<br /><br />

Those aged 55 years and over can withdraw any sum of money from their pension savings. The first 25% of cash taken is tax free, but further withdrawals will count towards taxable income.<br /><br />

<h4>Workplace pensions</h4>

All employers must provide a workplace pension scheme - this is called 'automatic enrolment'.  <br /><br />

Employers must automatically enrol employees into a pension scheme and make contribution if all of the following apply:  <br /><br />

• the person is classed as a 'worker'; and  <br /><br />

• aged between 22 and State Pension age; and  <br /><br />

• earns at least £10,000 per year; and<br /><br />

• usually (ordinarily) works in the UK.<br /><br />

Employers do not have to enrol employees if any of the following apply:<br /><br />

• the employee has given notice of leaving their job; • they have evidence of an employee's lifetime allowance protection;<br /><br />

• the employee receives a one-off payment from a workplace pension scheme that's closed (a 'winding up lump sum'), leaves and rejoins within 12 months of getting the payment;<br /><br />

• if more than 12 months before the staging date, an employee left ('opted out') an employment related pension;<br /><br />

• the employee is from an EU member state and is in a EU cross-border pension scheme;<br /><br />
• is in a limited liability partnership; or<br /><br />

• a director without an employment contract and the company employs at least one other person.<br /><br />

Employers and employees must pay a prescribed percentage of an employee's earnings into their workplace pension scheme.<br /><br />

In most schemes, contributions will be based on an employee's total pre-tax earnings between £6,240 and £50,270.<br /><br />

Total earnings include:<br /><br />

• salary or wages<br /><br />

• bonuses and commission<br /><br />

• overtime<br /><br />

• statutory sick pay<br /><br />

• statutory maternity, paternity or adoption pay

<h4>Workplace pension contributions (from 6 April 2019)</h4>

<table className="table">
    <tr className="trcolor">
       <td>Minimum employer contributions</td> 
       <td>Employee</td>
       <td>Total minimum contribution</td>
    </tr>

        <td>3%</td>
        <td>5%</td>
        <td>8%</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>
In some schemes, an employer has the option to pay in more than the legal minimum. In these schemes, an employee may pay in less as long the total minimum contribution is met.  <br /><br />

If an employee is voluntarily enrolled in a workplace pension, an employer must contribute the minimum amount if where they earn more than:  <br /><br />

• £520 a month  <br /><br />

• £120 a week  <br /><br />

• £480 over 4 weeks  <br /><br />

<b>Give your children or grandchildren a helping hand.</b> <br /><br />

If you have children, grandchildren, nephews, or nieces, why not take advantage of the UK government's generosity by putting money into their own children's pension?  <br /><br />

Money put into a child's pension gets the same tax relief as any other pension. So, even though your child is not a taxpayer, the taxman will add 20% to payments made, up to a maximum £3,600 each tax year (£2,880 of relatives' contributions and £720 in tax relief). <br /><br />

<b>Have you lost track of your pension(s)?</b> <br /><br />

Most of us will have worked for a number of employers over the years, and it can be easy to lose track of old pensions. You can find old pensions through the Pension Tracing Service.<br /><br />

<b>Are you aware of the 2015 Pension Reforms?</b> <br /><br />

Changes in April 2015 have removed the need to buy an annuity to provide income until you die, giving access to invest-and-drawdown schemes previously restricted to wealthier savers. The 55 percent 'death tax' on pension pots left invested has also been axed.<br /><br />

These changes apply to people with 'defined contribution' pensions who invest them in order to receive a pot of money at retirement. They don't apply to those with guaranteed final salary pensions.
