    <h3>Capital Allowances</h3>
 <p>A capital allowance is the amount of expenditure that a business may claim against its taxable profit under the Capital Allowances 2001 Act.

<h4>First Year Allowances (FYAS)</h4>

Subject to some exclusion, 100% allowances are available on the following types of expenditure incurred by a business of any size. <br /><br />

• Energy saving plant and machinery <br />

• Cars with very low CO2 emissions <br />

• Zero emission goods vehicles <br />

. Plant or machinery for gas refuelling stations • Plant or machinery for electric vehicle charging point <br />

• Plant or machinery (other than a long-life asset) for use by a company wholly in a ring fence trade <br />

• Environmentally beneficial plant or machinery <br />

• Plant or machinery for use in a freeport tax site <br />

<h4>Note:</h4>

If FYAs are not claimed, a writing-down allowance (WDA) is normally available on a reducing balance basis.

<h4>Annual Investment Allowance (AIAs)</h4>

From 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2021 the maximum claimable AIA is £1,000,000 (£200,000, previously). <br /><br />

After 31 December 2021 the maximum claimable AIA will revert to £200,000. <br /><br />


Where a chargeable period spans the above dates of change, (i.e. 1 January 2019 and 31 December 2021), the maximum AIA is calculated by splitting the chargeable period into separate periods falling before and after each of the dates of change. <br /><br />

Transitional rules then applied to determine the maximum AIA available in respect of the total chargeable period and the maximum AIA that may be allocated against qualifying expenditure incurred in each of the separate periods. <br /><br />

<h4>Plant and machinery: temporary first-year allowances (FYAS)</h4>

As part of his March 2021 Budget speech, the Chancellor announced that the following temporary first-year allowances would be introduced for companies incurring expenditure on new (i.e. unused and not second-hand) plant and machinery between 1 April 2021 and 31 March 2023: <br /><br />

• The 'super-deduction of 130% for main-rate

expenditure; <br /><br />

• The 'SR allowance' of 50% for special-rate expenditure; <br />

and <br />

• A 100% FYA for ring fence trades.

<h4>Other Capital Allowances</h4>

Plant and machinery different to those listed above (please check as rules apply). <br /><br />

Cars, more than 110g/km (CO2) and any key features 6% of buildings and lifetime assets.
