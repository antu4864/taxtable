            <h4>Flat Rate Scheme</h4>

*Under the FRS you can keep the difference between the output tax you charge customers and the amount of VAT you pay over to HMRC. However, with few exceptions you cannot reclaim input tax on what you buy. <br /><br />

** You do not have to exit the FRS if your estimated income for the following year is not expected to exceed £191,500. <br /><br />

Limited cost traders use the Flat Rate Scheme, but their percentage will be an unattractive 16.5%. <br /><br />

• A limited cost trader is defined as one that spends less than 2% of its sales on goods (not services) in an accounting period. <br /><br />

• A firm will also be a limited cost trader if it spends less than £1,000 a year (£250 per quarterly return period), even if this is more than 2% of the firm's turnover on goods. <br /><br />

<h5>Temporary flat-rate percentages from 15 July 2020 - 30 September 2021</h5>

As part of the government's package of measures to support the economy during the covid-19 crisis certain supplies in the hospitality sector are temporarily reduced rate.

            <h4>Agricultural flat rate scheme</h4>

Effective from 1 January 2021 new entry and exit rules have been implemented to establish turnover thresholds.<br /><br />

Businesses can join the Agricultural Flat Rate Scheme (AFRS) when their annual turnover for farming related activities is below £150 000 and non-farming related activity is below £85 000.<br /><br />

They must notify HMRC once their annual turnover for farming related activity exceeds £230 000. They will be deregistered from the scheme and must register for VAT instead.<br /><br />

Businesses with turnover from non-farming related activities that exceeds £85 000 will be required to register for VAT and will therefore be ineligible for the scheme.
