  <h3>Please note:</h3>

• 20 March 2020, in response to the coronavirus (COVID 19) outbreak, the government announced that it will be increasing the universal credit standard allowance and the working tax credit basic element by £20 a week to April 2021. This has now been extended to September 2021.

<h3>Student Loan deductions</h3>

<h4>Plan 1</h4>

2021/22: 9% charge on income above the threshold of £19,895 per year, £1,658 per month or £382 per week. <br /><br />

2020/21:9% charge on income above the threshold of £19,390 per year, £1,615 per month or £372 per week.

<h4>Plan 2</h4>

2021/22: 9% charge on income above the threshold of £27,295 per year, £2,275 per month or £525 per week. <br /><br />

2020/21:9% charge on income above the threshold of £26,575 per year, £2,214 per month or £511 per week.

<h3>Postgraduate loans</h3>

2021/22: 6% charge on income above the threshold of £21,000 per year, £1,750 per month or £403 per week. <br /><br />

2020/21: 6% charge on income above the threshold of £21,000 per year, £1,750 per month or £403 per week. <br /><br /> 

Broadly, an employer must start making loan deductions from the next available payday using the correct plan type if any of the following apply: <br /><br />

• a new employee's P45 shows deductions should continue - the employer will need to ascertain which plan type the employee has; a new employee confirms they are repaying a student

loan - again, the employer will need to confirm the

plan type; <br /><br />

• a new employee completes a starter checklist showing they have a student loan - the checklist will tell the employer which plan type to use; or <br /><br />

• HMRC issues form SL1 (Start Notice), which will tell the employer which plan type to use.
